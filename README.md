# alx-graphql-0x00
Project Overview & Summary: The Rick and Morty GraphQL API Explorer
This project is a multi-phase learning journey designed to build 
proficiency in GraphQL, from writing basic queries to integrating them 
into a modern, full-stack React application. The project uses the popular 
Rick and Morty API as its data source, providing a fun and engaging 
context for learning.

The work is segmented into four distinct directories (alx-graphql-0x00 to 
alx-graphql-0x02), each representing a progressive level of complexity and 
application.
